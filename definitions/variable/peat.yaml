    Grid fraction covered by the natural, drained, restored or mineral (i.e. not peat)
    peat types. Should be reported separately for each peat soil type (see note below
    the table). Report only one year if fixed percentage is used, or time series if
    values are determined dynamically.

    Hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Should be reported separately for each peat
    soil type (see note below the table). If possible, provide for all depth layers
    (i.e. 3D-field), and indicate depth in m. Otherwise, provide integrated over the
    entire soil depth. If depth varies over time or space, see instructions for depth
    layers on <https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files>.

    Water table level relative to the ground surface. Note that a negative value should
    depict a water table below the soil surface. If the model works with subgrid topographic
    variation (microtopography approach in peatlands), the reference soil surface
    for **wt** is represented by the mean elevation of the soil surface. Should be
    reported separately for each peat soil type (see note below the table).
