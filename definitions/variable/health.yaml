    For ERF models, this occurs when temperature is below threshold (e.g., minimum
    mortality temperature (MMT)). Report 0 if temperature above threshold. Can have
    gender, age, etc. dimensions; see below.

    To be reported as annual series of mean daily total mortality, or as a single

    Baseline population data should be provided for computations of mortality rates
    (i.e. deaths per total population). See Section ‎5.1.6. Can have gender, age,
    etc. dimensions; see below.
