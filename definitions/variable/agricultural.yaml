    Integral of the total nitrogen application rate over the growing season. If organic
    and inorganic amendments are applied, the nitrogen application should be reported
    as effective inorganic nitrogen input (ignoring residues).

    As Julian dates. The planting date reported here corresponds to the actual planting
    date in the simulation and may differ from the prescribed crop calendar planting
    date in rare cases as certain models may delay prescribed planting for a few days
    to have more suitable soil moisture and temperature conditions.
