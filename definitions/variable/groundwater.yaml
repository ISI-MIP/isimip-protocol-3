    heads on the top productive aquifer (confined or unconfined).

    Exchange flux between groundwater and surface water. Groundwater leaving the aquifer
    = negative value. When surface water enters the aquifer, this is positive.

    Flow of groundwater into oceans. The definition may vary by model. But in principle
    also models without density driven flow can submit this variable.
