    forestry: Stand total and species information is essential. If lai is static,
      the timestep specifier "fixed" can be used.
    other: Grid cell total and PFT information is essential. If lai is static, the
      timestep specifier "fixed" can be used.
    water_global: If used by, or computed by the model. If lai is static, the timestep
      specifier "fixed" can be used.

    The categories may differ from model to model, depending on their PFT definitions.
    This may include natural PFTs, anthropogenic PFTs, bare soil, lakes, urban areas,
    etc. Sum of all should equal the fraction of the grid cell that is land. For models
    that have grid cells partially covered by land and ocean, please document this
    in the model documentation and provide your land-sea mask along the data uploads.
