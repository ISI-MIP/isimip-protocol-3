    Soil type as used by your model. Please include a description of each type in
    the model documentation (under "Other data sets used"). Please also include a
    link to a database/paper describing the parameters and values associated with
    these soil types.

    The fraction of each grid cell that is assumed to be continent, i.e., not ocean.
    Should be 0 if the entire cell is assumed to be ocean, 1 if the entire cell is
    assumed to be covered by land or inland water bodies.
