    Soil type as used by your model. Please include a description of each type in
    the model documentation (under "Other data sets used"). Please also include a
    link to a database/paper describing the parameters and values associated with
    these soil types.

    The fraction of each grid cell that is assumed to be continent, i.e. including inland water bodies but excluding ocean shares.
    Should be 0 if the entire cell is assumed to be ocean, 1 if the entire cell is
    assumed to be covered by land or inland water bodies.
