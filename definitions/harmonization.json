Modelers should have planting as closely as possible to these dates, but it may be admissible to use these dates as indicators for planting windows (depending on model specifics)."

    "title": "Harmonized seasons with no N constraints",
    "description": "For models with an explicit description of the nitrogen cycle: harmnon simulations should be run with nitrogen stress turned off completely or (if that’s not possible) with very high N application rates to make model results comparable between those GGCMs that have explicit N dynamics and those that do not. For models without the nitrogen cycle: harmnon and fullharm simulations are the same and do not need to be duplicated. Please contact the sector coordination to push on with this side branch."
