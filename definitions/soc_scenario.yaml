    Varying direct human influences in the historical period.
  description_note: Please label your model run `histsoc` **even if** it only partly
    accounts for varying direct human forcings while another part of the the direct
    human forcing is considered constant or is ignored.

  description: >-
    Fixed year-1850 direct human influences (e.g. land use, nitrogen deposition and
    fertilizer input, fishing effort).
  description_note: Please label your simulations `1850soc` if they do not at all
    account for historical changes in direct human forcing, but they do represent
    constant year-1850 levels of direct human forcing for at least some direct human
    forcings. This scenario may be thought of an approximation of pre-industrial levels
    of human impacts.

  description: >-
    Fixed year-2015 direct human influences (e.g. land use, nitrogen deposition and

    was using varying direct human influences in the historical period.
  description_note: Please label your simulations `2015soc-from-histsoc` for the future
    period, if your model run extends a historical period which used the `histsoc`
    scenario. This distinguishes the data from experiments which use both `2015soc`
    in the past and the future. If your model output is identical for both cases,
    please only submit the `2015soc` files for the future period.
