### 3.1 Forcing data

Table 3.1 describes the **climate-related, direct human, static geographic, and biophysical forcing data** provided for the different experiments. The datasets are grouped according to the main experiment specifiers described in 2.2 - 2.4. The different datasets and the variables they contain are described in more detail in Tables 3.3 - 3.6.

For each dataset, we provide the path where modellers can obtain the data at DKRZ. The base directory for this is:

    levante:/work/bb0820/ISIMIP/

The data is also available at the [ISIMIP Repository](https://data.isimip.org) without login, or will be made available there in the future. Further information on accessing ISIMIP data can be found at [ISIMIP - getting started](https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/data-access/).

Some of the datasets are tagged as [mandatory]. This does not mean that the data must be used in all cases, but **if** your models uses input data of this kind, we require to use the specified dataset. If an alternative data set is used instead, we cannot consider it an ISIMIP simulation. If the [mandatory] label is not given, you may use alternative data (please document this clearly).

### 3.2 Climate related forcing

::: show simulation_round=ISIMIP3a

    The climate forcing input files can be found on DKRZ using the following pattern:

        ISIMIP3a/InputData/climate/atmosphere/<climate-scenario>/global/daily/historical/<climate-forcing>/<climate-forcing>_<climate-scenario>_<climate-variable>_global_daily_<start-year>_<end-year>.nc

        # ocean data for marine-fishery
        ISIMIP3a/InputData/climate/ocean/<climate-scenario>/global/monthly/historical/<climate-forcing>/<climate-forcing>_<climate-scenario>_<climate-variable>_global_monthly_<start-year>_<end-year>.nc

::: show simulation_round=ISIMIP3b

    The climate forcing input files can be found on DKRZ using the following pattern:

        ISIMIP3b/InputData/climate/atmosphere/bias-adjusted/global/daily/<climate-scenario>/<climate-forcing>/<climate-forcing>_<ensemble-member>_<bias-adjustment>_<climate-scenario>_<climate-variable>_global_daily_<start-year>_<end-year>.nc

        # ocean data for marine-fishery
        ISIMIP3b/InputData/climate/ocean/uncorrected/global/monthly/<climate-scenario>/<climate-forcing>/<climate-forcing>_<ensemble-member>_<climate-scenario>_<climate-variable>_onedeg_global_monthly_<start-year>_<end-year>.nc  # 1° grid
        ISIMIP3b/InputData/climate/ocean/uncorrected/global/monthly/<climate-scenario>/<climate-forcing>/<climate-forcing>_<ensemble-member>_<climate-scenario>_<climate-variable>_halfdeg_global_monthly_<start-year>_<end-year>.nc  # 0.5° grid

::: show simulation_round=ISIMIP3b sector=marine-fishery_global,marine-fishery_regional

    #### Note on ocean data availability

    Variable availability is mainly based on the data published in ESGF
    and may vary between the CMIP experiments.

    Some variables are available as extracted versions from vertically resolved data. Their
    variable names have been suffixed with **-bot** (ocean bottom), **-surf**
    (surface values) or **-vint** (vertically integrated), respectively.

#### Climate forcing

::: table identifier=climate_forcing caption="Table 3.2: Climate forcing datasets (`climate-forcing`)."

#### Note on climate forcing priority

The priority for the different climate forcing datasets is given in the last column of Table 3.1. If you cannot use all climate forcing datasets, please concentrate on those with a higher priority. Please note, that for ISIMIP3b group III simulations we provide the priorities of the different experiments in Table 2.5.

#### Climate related variables

### 3.2 Direct human forcing

::: table identifier=soc_dataset caption="Table 3.4: Direct human forcing variables."

### 3.3 Static geographic information

::: table identifier=geo_dataset caption="Table 3.5: Geographic data and information."

### 3.4 Upstream impact model data

::: table identifier=upstream_variable caption="Table 3.6: Input data from other ISIMIP impact models."

::: hide sector=fs-n,groundwater

    No input data from other ISIMIP impact models are available for this selection of simulation round and sectors.
