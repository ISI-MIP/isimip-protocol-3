The specification on how to submit the data, as well as further information and instructions are given on the ISIMIP website at:

<https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files>

It is important that you comply precisely with the formatting specified there, in order to facilitate the analysis of your simulation results in the ISIMIP framework. Incorrect formatting can
seriously delay the analysis. The ISIMIP Team will be glad to assist with the preparation of these files if necessary.

To ensure consistency between ISIMIP3a and ISIMIP3b as well as the different experiments within a simulation round, we require that modelling groups use the same version of an impact model for the experiments in ISIMIP3a and ISIMIP3b. If you cannot fulfill this, please indicate that by using a suffix for your model name (e.g. simple version numbering: MODEL-v1, MODEL-v2 or following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org): MODEL-2.0.0).

This versioning does not only apply to changes in the computational logic of the model, but also to input parameters, calibration or setup. If model versions are not reported, we will name them according to the simulation round (e.g. MODEL-isimip3a). We require the strict versioning to ensure that differences between model results are fully attributable to the changes in model forcings.

File names consist of a series of identifier, separated by underscores. Things to note:

* Report one variable per file.
* In filenames, use lowercase letters only.
* Use underscore (`_`) to separate identifiers.
* Variable names consist of a single word without hyphens or underscores.
* Use hyphens (`-`) to separate strings within an identifier, e.g. in a model name.
* If no specific `sens-scenario` is given in the experiments table, use `default`.
* Data model is NETCDF4_CLASSIC with minimum compression level of `5`.
* NetCDF file extension is `.nc`.
* The relative time axis' reference year is `1901` for ISIMIP3a and `1601` for ISIMIP3b.
* `!!!`**[modified 2022-12-08]** Use the `standard`, `proleptic_gregorian`, or `365_day` calendar depending on the temporal resolution of your model for **all** types of reported temporal resolutions and write data based on a **daily time index** (`days since ...`). Avoid using the `360_day` calendar for monthly and annual data.
* For fixed variables (e.g. cellarea, contfrac) omit the NetCDF-internal times dimension and the period identifiers in the file name.

Please name the files according to a sector specific pattern:

::: pattern

and replace the identifiers with the specifiers given in the different tables of this document:

* [Experiments](#2-experiments): Table 2.2: `climate-scenario`, Table 2.3: `soc-scenario`, Table 2.4: `sens-scenario`
* [Input data](#3-input-data): Table 3.1: `climate-forcing`, Table 3.2: `bias-adjustment`
* [Output data](#4-output-data): Table 4.1: `variable`, `resolution`, `time-step`, Table 4.6 - 4.9: `region` (or `global` for most sectors) 

For questions or clarifications, please contact <mailto:info@isimip.org> or the data managers directly (<mailto:isimip-data@pik‐potsdam.de>) before submitting files.
