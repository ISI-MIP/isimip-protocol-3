The specification on how to submit the data, as well as further information and instructions are given on the ISIMIP website at:

<https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files>

It is important that you comply precisely with the formatting specified there, in order to facilitate the analysis of your simulation results in the ISIMIP framework. Incorrect formatting can
seriously delay the analysis. The ISIMIP Team will be glad to assist with the preparation of these files if necessary.

File names consist of a series of identifier, separated by underscores. Things to note:

* Report one variable per file.
* In filenames, use lowercase letters only.
* Use underscore (`_`) to separate identifiers.
* Variable names consist of a single word without hyphens or underscores.
* Use hyphens (`-`) to separate strings within an identifier, e.g. in a model name.
* If no specific `sens-scenario` is given in the experiments table, use `default`.
* Data model is NETCDF4_CLASSIC with minimum compression level of `5`.
* NetCDF file extension is `.nc`.
* The relative time axis' reference year for {{ simulation_round.specifier }} is `{{ (definitions.time_span|selectattr("specifier", "eq", "minimum")|first).value[simulation_round.specifier] }}`.
* for daily data use `standard`, `proleptic_gregorian`, `366_day`, `365_day` or `360_day` calendar depending on the temporal resolution of your model and the `360_day` calendar for non-daily data.


Please name the files in the {{ sector.title }} sector according to the following pattern:

```
{{ pattern_simple }}
```

and replace the identifiers with the specifiers given in the tables of this document. Examples would be:

{% if simulation_round.specifier.endswith('a') %}
```
lpjml_gswp3_obsclim_histsoc_default_qtot_global_annual_1901_1910.nc
lpjml_gwsp3_counterclim_2015soc_1901co2_yield-mai-noirr_global_annual_2006_2010.nc
```
{% else %}
```
lpjml_gfdl-esm4_w5e5_picontrol_histsoc_default_qtot_global_annual_2001_2010.nc
lpjml_ukesm1-0-ll_w5e5_ssp585_2015soc_2015co2_yield-mai-noirr_global_annual_2006_2010.nc
```
{% endif %}

The following regular expression can be used to validate and parse the file name for the {{ sector.title|lower }} sector:

```
{{ pattern }}
```

For questions or clarifications, please contact <mailto:info@isimip.org> or the data managers directly (<mailto:isimip-data@pik‐potsdam.de>) before submitting files.
