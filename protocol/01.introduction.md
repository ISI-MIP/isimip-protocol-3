### General concept

ISIMIP provides a framework for the collation of a consistent set of climate impact data across sectors and scales. This framework will serve as a basis for model evaluation and improvement, allowing for improved estimates of the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change at different levels of global warming. It also provides a unique opportunity for considering interactions between climate change impacts across sectors through consistent scenarios.

ISIMIP is intended to be structured in successive rounds, each having its own focus topics and focus regions that inform the scenario design. The main components of the ISIMIP framework are:

* A common set of climate and other input data which will be distributed via a central database;
* A common modelling protocol to ensure consistency across sectors and scales in terms of data, format and scenario set-up;
* A central archive where the output data will be collected and made available to the scientific community.
