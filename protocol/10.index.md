# ISIMIP3 simulation protocol

ISIMIP provides a framework for the collation of a consistent set of climate impact data across sectors and scales. It also provides a unique opportunity for considering interactions between climate change impacts across sectors through consistent scenarios.

ISIMIP is intended to be structured in successives rounds connected to the different phases of the climate model intercomparison CMIP ([ISIMIP Mission & Implementation document](https://www.isimip.org/documents/355/MissionAndImplementation_12Sep2018.pdf)).

The ISIMIP3a/3b protocol follows the known convention with the 3a-part addressing the historical period and designed for model evaluation and the 3b-part addressing historic and future impact projections.

Please select the protocol for the sector you are working on from the list below.
