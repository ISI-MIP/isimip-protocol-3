ISIMIP output variables are usually reported with the dimensions **(time,lat,lon)**. Alternative dimensions for specific variables are given in the comment column in the table below. More information about additional dimensions can be found [on the ISIMIP website](https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files/#requirements-for-variables-with-varying-levels).

Unless otherwise defined, variables in ISIMIP should be reported relative to the grid cell land area.
