ISIMIP output variables are usually reported with the dimensions **(time,lat,lon)**. For variables with a number of levels (e.g. layers or depth), an alternative set of dimensions is given in the comment column in the table below. More information about level dimensions can be found [here](https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files/#requirements-for-variables-with-fixed-levels) and [here](https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files/#requirements-for-variables-with-varying-levels) on the ISIMIP webpage.

Please note that unless otherwise defined, the variables in ISIMIP should be reported relative to the grid cell land area.
