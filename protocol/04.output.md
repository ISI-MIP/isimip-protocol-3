Variables are to be reported with the dimensions **(time,lat,lon)** where the time axis' unit is '`growing seasons since {{ (definitions.time_span|selectattr("specifier", "eq", "minimum")|first).value[simulation_round.specifier] }}-01-01 00:00:00`' for all variables unless these are reported on a transient time axis, e.g. 'soilmoist1m'. In many cases growing seasons are equivalent to years, as there is always only one planting event per year. However, due to temperature-sensitive growing season lengths, the growing seasons are not fully equivalent to years and users should note the difference. Reported variables on start and end of the growing season are supplied to allow allocating events to transient time axes if desired.

ISIMIP output variables are usually reported with the dimensions **(time,lat,lon)**. For variables with a number of levels (e.g. layers or depth), an alternative set of dimensions is given in the comment column in the table below. More information about level dimensions can be found [here](https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files/#requirements-for-variables-with-fixed-levels) and [here](https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files/#requirements-for-variables-with-varying-levels) on the ISIMIP webpage.
{% endif %}

Please note that unless otherwise defined, the variables in ISIMIP should be reported relative to the grid cell land area.
