### Output dimensions

ISIMIP output variables are usually reported with the dimensions **(time,lat,lon)**. For variables with a number of levels (e.g. layers or depth), an alternative set of dimensions is given in the comment column in the table below. More information about level dimensions can be found [here](https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files/#requirements-for-variables-with-fixed-levels) and [here](https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files/#requirements-for-variables-with-varying-levels) on the ISIMIP webpage.

    #### Note on agriculture output

    For agricultural output, variables are to be reported with the dimensions **(time,lat,lon)** where the time axis' unit is `growing seasons since 1901-01-01 00:00:00` resp. `growing seasons since 1661-01-01 00:00:00` for all variables unless these are reported on a transient time axis, e.g. 'soilmoist1m'. In many cases growing seasons are equivalent to years, as there is always only one planting event per year. However, due to temperature-sensitive growing season lengths, the growing seasons are not fully equivalent to years and users should note the difference. Reported variables on start and end of the growing season are supplied to allow allocating events to transient time axes if desired.

Please note that unless otherwise defined, the variables in ISIMIP should be reported relative to the grid cell land area.

    #### Reporting per growing seasons

    To resolve potential double harvests within one year, crop yields should be reported per growing season and not per calendar year. Thus, in the NetCDF output files, do not use a time dimension but instead a unitless coordinate variable with integer values; more information on how to construct these files is given below and on the ISIMIP website (<https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files/>).

    Cumulative growing season variables such as, e.g., actual evapotranspiration or precipitation are to be accumulated over the growing season. The first season in the file (level=0) is then the first complete growing season of the time period provided by the input data without any assumed spin-up data, which equates to the growing season with the first planting after this date. To ensure that data can be matched to individual years in post-processing, it is essential to also provide the actual planting dates (as day of the year), actual planting years (year), anthesis dates (as day of the year), year of anthesis (year), maturity dates (day of the year), and year of maturity (year). This procedure is identical to the GGCMI convention (Elliott, et al., 2015).

    #### Information about PFT-specific outputs

    * Unless otherwise defined, variables in ISIMIP should be reported relative to the grid cell land area.
    * The output provided per Plant Functional Type (PFT) should be expressed relative to the respective PFT area so that e.g. sum(gpp-pft\*pft-pft)=gpp-total.
    * When your model allows several PFTs to grow on the same area and hence the total cover fraction can be more than one, please scale the PFT area to one and report this step in the model documentation on the ISIMIP homepage.
    * When your model grows the same PFT on different land-use classes, e.g. the same c3-grass represents grasses growing on natural grasslands, pasture and possible even as crop, please differentiate this in your output by defining land-use specific PFT such as c3-grass-pasture, c3-grass-natural, c3-grass-crop and report this in model documentation on the ISIMIP homepage.

::: show sector=health

    #### Additional instructions for the health sector

    * If different realizations of the model are applied, then these should be indicated by the specifier `<r>`.
        E.g. to reflect a central, upper, and lower estimate of the ERF: `<r> = lower, central, upper`.
        Please explain the meaning of these realizations in the online model documentation; contact the ISIMIP coordination team in case of questions.
    * If data are disaggregated e.g. by age group, gender, etc., they should be reported along an additional
        dimension, described by an auxiliary coordinate variable, in the NetCDF files. See the example provided
        at <https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files/>.
    * For local (non-gridded) data, locations (cities/regions/countries) should be reported along an additional
        dimension called location, with the location name given as string in an auxiliary coordinate variable
        called location_name, in the NetCDF files. In addition, coordinates of the location should be reported
        in auxiliary variables called location_lat and location_lon. See the example provided at
        <https://www.isimip.org/protocol/preparing-simulation-files/>. The `<region>` specifier in the
        file name should be set to `local`. For gridded data, the `<region>` specifier in the file name 
        should be `global` or indicate a region or country.
