# ISIMIP3 simulation protocol

    <p>
        <strong>Update:</strong> ISIMIP3b Group III (simulations accounting for future changes in the direct human forcing) input data are now available and simulations can be started for a set of sectors (indicated by <span class="badge-split"><span class="badge badge-info badge-left"><span class="circle circle-green"></span></span><span class="badge badge-info badge-right">III</span></span> in the menu). For other sectors, some of the data are not available yet (indicated by <span class="badge-split"><span class="badge badge-info badge-left"><span class="circle-left circle-green"></span><span class="circle-right circle-yellow"></span></span><span class="badge badge-info badge-right">III</span></span>), but models not needing those data may already start. For a third group of sectors (indicated by <span class="badge-split"><span class="badge badge-info badge-left"><span class="circle circle-yellow"></span></span><span class="badge badge-info badge-right">III</span></span>) Group III experiments have been defined but are not ready to begin because most of the data are still under construction.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Group III we introduce new <strong>experiments</strong> (Table 2.1), new <strong>direct human forcing specifiers</strong> (Table 2.3), a new <strong>table of priorities</strong> (Table 2.5), a new <strong>table of requirements</strong> (Table 2.6), and the new <strong>input data</strong> are added to Tables 3.1 and 3.4.
