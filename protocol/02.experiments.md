### 2.1 Experiments

In Table 2.1, we describe the different experiments for ISIMIP3. Each default experiment is defined by its **climate related forcing (CRF)** and the assumptions regarding **direct human forcing (DHF)**. The associated specifications all have a label such as `obsclim` or `histsoc` that are provided in Table 2.1 and further specified in Tables 2.2 and 2.3. These specifiers are used in the file names of the corresponding input files and should also be used for the names of the output files (see report model results [report model results](#5-reporting-model-results)). Sensitivity experiments are described as deviation from a default experiment and represented by labels that are used as a third specifier of the experiments. Their specific meanings are defined in Table 2.4.

Please note that the experiments are different for ISIMIP3a and ISIMIP3b and some are sector specific. You can use the menu on the top-right of the page to select the sumulation round and sectors you are interested in.

#### Note regarding models requiring spin-up

::: show simulation_round=ISIMIP3a

    For models requiring spin-up, we provide 100 years of spinclim data which is identical with the first 100 years of the counterclim data. The files are located under `ISIMIP3a/InputData/climate/atmosphere/spinclim` at DKRZ and in the ISIMIP Repository. If more than 100 years of spin-up are needed, these data can be repeated as often as needed. 

    For `historical` runs, use the `transclim` climate time series, historical CO₂ concentration and varying DHF, for the transition period from spin-up to the start of the experiment (1850-1900). When using a longer spin-up period that (nominally) extends back further than 1850, please keep CO₂ concentration and DHF constant at 1850 level until reaching the year corresponding to 1850.

    For experiments with fixed direct human influences (`1901soc`, `2015soc`), the spin-up should be based on the 1901 DHF or 2015 DHF, respectively.

    For sector-specific experiments without direct human influence (`nat`), the spin-up should not use any DHF as well.

::: show simulation_round=ISIMIP3a sector=marine-fishery_global,marine-fishery_regional

    The model evaluation experiment starts in 1961. To capture historical fishing effort prior
    to 1961, we also provide input for a nominal spin-up (1841-1860, fishing held constant
    at 1861 levels) and pre-industrial transition period (1861-1960, reconstructed fishing
    effort).

    To set-up climate-forcing variables for the entire 1841-1960 period, we ask modellers to
    use the "control run" (`ctrlclim`) monthly output for the years 1961-1980 (inclusive) on
    repeat for six cycles. These years have been selected because they correspond with
    an entire ENSO cycle and because no climate trend is detectable prior to 1980 from the
    GFDL model.

    For models that require longer spin-up prior to 1841, please keep 1841 levels of fishing
    effort constant and, if needed, repeat the ENSO cycle (e.g. monthly values for 1961-
    1980 inclusive from `ctrlclim`) for as many times necessary.
    For the ‘no fishing’ runs (`nat`), the spin-up and pre-industrial transition should not use
    any fishing effort.

    We ask modellers to include all outputs from 1841 onwards for use in our analyses.

::: show simulation_round=ISIMIP3b

    For models requiring spin-up, please use the pre-industrial control data and CO₂ concentration and DHF fixed at 1850 levels for the spin up as long as needed.

    Please note that the "pre-industrial control run" from 1601-1849 is part of the regular experiments that should be reported and hence the spin-up has to be finished before that.

    For experiments with fixed year-2015 direct human influences (`2015soc`), spin-up should be based on the 2015 DHF.

    For sector-specific experiments without direct human influence (nat), the spin-up should not use any DHF as well.

    Please note that there is no "pre-industrial control run" from 1601-1849 for these experiments (`2015soc`, `nat`) and hence the spin-up links directly to the historical period. 

### 2.2 Experiment specifiers

Tables 2.2-2.4 describe the different specifiers for the different experiments as described in Table 2.1. They are used in the file names of the corresponding input files and should also be used for the names of the output files (see [report model results](#5-reporting-model-results)).

All ISMIP experiments are described by specifying the underlying set of climate-related forcings and direct human forcings. Some of the forcing data sets are [mandatory]: i.e. if impact models account for the forcing, the specified dataset must be used; if an alternative input data set is used instead, the run cannot be considered an ISIMIP simulation.

    #### General note regarding sensitivity experiments

    The sensitivity experiments are meant to be deviations from the default settings. So for example if your model does not at all account for changes in CO₂ concentrations (no option to switch it on or off) the run should be labeled as “default” in the sensitivity specifier of the file name even if the run would be identical to the `1901co2` sensitivity setting.

    The particular sensitivity specifier for an experiment is given in the experiments table above. For most experiments no sensitivity specifier is given, so the `default` label applies.
