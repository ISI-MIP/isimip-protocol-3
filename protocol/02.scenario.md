#### General note regarding sensitivity experiments

{% if simulation_round.specifier.endswith('a') %}

The sensitivity experiments are meant to be "artificial" deviations from the default settings. So for example if your model does not at all account for changes in CO₂ concentrations (no option to switch it on or off) the run should be labeled as “default” in the sensitivity specifier of the file name even if the run would be identical to the `1901co2` sensitivity setting.

### Experiments

#### Note regarding models requiring spin-up

{% if simulation_round.specifier.endswith('a') %}

For models requiring spin-up, we provide 100 years of spinclim data which is identical with the first 100 years of the counterclim data (files `climate/atmosphere/spinclim/<dataset>/<dataset>_spinclim_<variable>_global_daily_<start-year>_<start-year>.nc`). If more than 100 years of spin-up are needed, these data can be repeated as often as needed. Use historical CO2 concentration and varying DHF, for the transition period from spin-up to the start of the experiment (1860-1900). When using a longer spin-up period that (nominally) extends back further than 1860, please keep CO2 concentration and DHF constant at 1860 level until reaching the year corresponding to 1860.

{% else %}

For models requiring spin-up, please use the pre-industrial control data and CO₂ concentration and DHF fixed at 1850 levels for the spin up as long as needed. Please note that the "pre-industrial control run" from 1601-1849 is part of the regular experiments that should be reported and hence the spin-up has to be finished before that.
