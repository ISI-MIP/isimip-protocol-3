For models requiring spin-up, we provide 100 years of spinclim data which is identical with the first 100 years of the counterclim data (files `climate/atmosphere/spinclim/<dataset>/<dataset>_spinclim_<variable>_global_daily_<start-year>_<start-year>.nc`). If more than 100 years of spin-up are needed, these data can be repeated as often as needed.

Use historical COâ‚‚ concentration, as provided in the input data archive (filename: `composition_atmosphere/co2/co2_historical_annual_1765_2018.txt`), for the part of the spin-up directly preceding 1901. When using a longer spin-up period that (nominally) extends back further than 1765, please keep CO2 concentration constant at 1765 level until reaching the year corresponding to 1765.
