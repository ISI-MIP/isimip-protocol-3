    #### General note regarding sensitivity experiments

    The sensitivity experiments are meant to be "artificial" deviations from the default settings. So for example if your model does not at all account for changes in CO₂ concentrations (no option to switch it on or off) the run should be labeled as “default” in the sensitivity specifier of the file name even if the run would be identical to the `1901co2` sensitivity setting.

    The particular sensitivity scenario for an experiment is given in the experiments table below. For most experiments no sensitivity scenario is given, so the `default` label applies.

#### Note regarding models requiring spin-up

::: show simulation_round=ISIMIP3a

    For models requiring spin-up, we provide 100 years of spinclim data which is identical with the first 100 years of the counterclim data. The files are located under `ISIMIP3a/InputData/climate/atmosphere/spinclim` at DKRZ and in the ISIMIP Repository. If more than 100 years of spin-up are needed, these data can be repeated as often as needed. 

    For `historical` runs, use historical CO2 concentration and varying DHF, for the transition period from spin-up to the start of the experiment (1850-1900). When using a longer spin-up period that (nominally) extends back further than 1850, please keep CO₂ concentration and DHF constant at 1850 level until reaching the year corresponding to 1850.

    For experiments with fixed direct human influences (`1901soc`, `2015soc`), the spin-up should be based on the 1901 DHF or 2015 DHF, respectively.

    For sector-specific experiments without direct human influence (nat), the spin-up should not use any DHF as well.

::: show simulation_round=ISIMIP3b

    For models requiring spin-up, please use the pre-industrial control data and CO₂ concentration and DHF fixed at 1850 levels for the spin up as long as needed.

    Please note that the "pre-industrial control run" from 1601-1849 is part of the regular experiments that should be reported and hence the spin-up has to be finished before that.

    For experiments with fixed year-2015 direct human influences (`2015soc`), spin-up should be based on the 2015 DHF.

    For sector-specific experiments without direct human influence (nat), the spin-up should not use any DHF as well.

    Please note that there is no "pre-industrial control run" from 1601-1849 for these experiments (`2015soc`, `nat`) and hence the spin-up links directly to the historical period.
