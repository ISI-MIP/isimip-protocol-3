hydrological-variables,soilmoist1m,Plant Available Water in Upper 1m Soil During Growing Season,kg m-3,0.5° grid,monthly,0.0,500.0,Monthly average actual absolute available soil water content of the upper 1m soil column (above wilting point) during growing season. Outside growing seasons values can be zero.
water-management-variables,pirnreqcum,Cumulative Potential Net Irrigation Water Requirement,kg m-2,0.5° grid,annual,0.0,3000.0,"Soil water demand required to avoid water stress accumulated across the growing season, excluding any water losses associated with application or transport and without constraints due to water availability; only needed for `firr` simulations."
agricultural-variables,yield,Crop Yields,dry matter (t ha-1),0.5° grid,annual,0.0,30.0,"Yield may be identical to above-ground biomass (biom) if the entire plant is harvested, e.g. for bioenergy production. Yields are reported per growing seasons and not per year."
agricultural-variables,evapcum,Cumulative Evapotranspiration,kg m-2,0.5° grid,annual,0.0,1500.0,"Evapotranspiration = sum of transpiration, evaporation, interception and sublimation aggregated across the growing season."
agricultural-variables,initrcum,Cumulative Nitrogen Application,kg ha-1,0.5° grid,annual,0.0,1000.0,"Integral of the total nitrogen application rate over the growing season. If organic and inorganic amendments are applied, the nitrogen application should be reported as effective inorganic nitrogen input (ignoring residues)."
agricultural-variables,plantday,Planting Date,day of year,0.5° grid,annual,1.0,366.0,As Julian dates. The planting date reported here corresponds to the actual planting date in the simulation and may differ from the prescribed crop calendar planting date in rare cases as certain models may delay prescribed planting for a few days to have more suitable soil moisture and temperature conditions.
agricultural-variables,plantyear,Planting Year,calendar year,0.5° grid,annual,1850.0,2100.0,
agricultural-variables,anthday,Anthesis Date,days from planting,0.5° grid,annual,30.0,200.0,Together with the day and year of planting it allows for clear identification of anthesis.
agricultural-variables,matyday,Maturity Date,days from planting,0.5° grid,annual,50.0,400.0,Together with the day and year of planting it allows for clear identification of maturity.
agricultural-variables,harvyear,Harvest Year,calendar year,0.5° grid,annual,1850.0,2100.0,Usually the year when maturity is reached. Can also be computed from planting and maturuty day.
agricultural-variables,biom,Total Above Ground Biomass Dry Matter Yields,t ha-1,0.5° grid,annual,0.0,50.0,The whole plant biomass above ground.
agricultural-variables,nupcum,Cumulative Nitrogen Uptake,kg ha-1,0.5° grid,annual,0.0,1000.0,Nitrogen balance: Uptake (growing season sum)
agricultural-variables,nincum,Cumulative Nitrogen Inputs,kg ha-1,0.5° grid,annual,0.0,1000.0,Nitrogen balance: Inputs (growing season sum)
agricultural-variables,nlosscum,Cumulative Nitrogen Losses,kg ha-1,0.5° grid,annual,0.0,1000.0,Nitrogen balance: Losses (growing season sum)
agricultural-variables,nleachcum,Cumulative Nitrogen Leached,kg ha-1,0.5° grid,annual,0.0,1000.0,Nitrogen balance: Leaching (growing season sum)
